# react-clean-form

`react-clean-form` is a component with goal of being a composable, un-opinionated form component that makes it easy to get a quick and easy form into your react app with out a lot of boilerplate code. `react-clean-form` manages state for you so you can simply bring it in to your project, add in form fields that use the `name` prop that corresponds to the properties in the `initialState` prop, and add a handleSubmit function to the `onSubmit` prop to capture the state of the form at submission. There is no need to add the `value` prop to your form fields, `react-clean-form` handles that for you. `react-clean-form` will reset the form to the initial state if a reset event is fired.

`react-clean-form` forwards the ref to the form element itself and all other `props` are passed directly to the `form` element, including `className` and `style`.

`react-clean-form` now exports a `useForm` hook that takes in an initialState and returns the form state and handleChange function in array, similar to `useState`

## Installation

`npm install react-clean-form`

## Usage

### Form Component

```javascript
import Form from 'react-clean-form';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Form initialState={{ input: '' }} onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input name="input" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      <button type="reset">Reset</button>
    </Form>
  </div>
);
```

### useForm Hook

```javascript
import {useForm} from 'react-clean-form';

const App = () => (
  const [formState, handleChange] = useForm({ input: '' });
  <div>
    <form onReset={handleChange}>
      <input name="input" onChange={handleChange} value={formState['input']} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      <button type="reset">Reset</button>
    </form>
  </div>
);
```
